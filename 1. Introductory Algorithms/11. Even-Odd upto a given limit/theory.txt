In C

we have following operators

int x;
int y;

addition of x and y is x+y

substraction of y from x is x-y

mult. of x and y is x*y

division of x(dividend) by y(divisor) is x/y
NOTE: if x and y are both of int datatype then x/y will give QUOTIENT only

Now,

there is an operator - x % y which gives the " remainder when x is divided by y "
